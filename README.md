# FrameworkDashboard

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.1.

## Thought Process

* When writing code, I like to start as simply as possible.  I believe the simplest way to display all of the required data is to use a sortable table, so that is where I will begin.
* Whenever I am deciding between multiple npm packages, I always check the package's stats on npmjs.com.  My feeling is that npm determined weekly downloads, issues, and pull requests are the best stats for determining the quality of a repository, so that is what I will use as well.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
